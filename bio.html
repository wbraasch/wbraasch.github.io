			I grew up in New Hampshire and fell in love with exploring woodland and mountain landscapes. As a high school student at Phillips Exeter Academy, I was influenced by the teaching environment there that places value on collaborative learning, open-mindedness, and creativity. I received my B.A. with a major in physics from St. Olaf College. After completing my undergraduate degree, I spent two years rock climbing, adventuring, and performing outdoor seasonal work. I then moved back to the northeast to pursue a Ph.D. in physics at Dartmouth College which I completed in 2020. In the summer of 2019, I attended the Complex Systems Summer School at the Santa Fe Institute. As a theoretical physicist, my research interests are in foundational aspects and applications of quantum mechanics.

			I am a theoretical physicist with interests in quantum information, quantum foundations, and quantum computing. My research focus is on distinguishing between systems behaving classically and those behaving quantum mechanically. The boundary between the classical and quantum worlds has been of intrinsic interest since the advent of quantum theory as highlighted in Schr\:{o}dingerâ€™s famous feline gedanken experiment. However, making this distinction precise has taken on new significance in the effort to realize technologies leveraging quantum mechanical principles to outperform classical competitors. My approach to this research problem has been within the Wigner function context in two ways: I have introduced a new tool for understanding open quantum system dynamics for continuous-variable systems and I have developed a formalism for describing general quantum operations for discrete-variable systems.
